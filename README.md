# Arduino-Line-following-bot
Older code from University project for my BEng, designed to allow a machine we created with signals incoming from photodiodes to follow a marked line along a floor, and then using a laser, read an input of time for laser to return and run a motor to launch a tennis ball at target.

Entirety of programming was left to me, and it was the beginning of my interest in programming. As we were a group of 5 mechanical engineers, none of us had coding experience and I took on the challenge to program the bot. Design, and creation of the machine was left to the other 4 members of the group. I learned a lot from this experience and gave myself a crash course based on Arduinos reference page.
